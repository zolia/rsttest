Any use of the Network or the Software after such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of such changes, modifications or additions. 

3. **YOUR ROLE**

The Mysterium Platform Open Alpha is a combination of the open source Software and the Network that allow users (the "Users") to enhance their privacy while using the internet. It is accomplished by creating virtual tunnels through one or more connections to other users of the Network (the “Nodes”) and by using their equipment and resources to route the Users to their final destinations. 

By enrolling into the Program or installing the Software, you agree to act as a Node operator and become a part of the Network. These Terms govern your participation in the Program as a Node. Therefore, you consent that the Users and we use your equipment, communication and other resources for the purposes of the Program.
